            <h3>Two players will take turns joining two adjacent
                dots with a horizontal or vertical line. When a player completes the fourth
                side of a box they must answer a computer science question. If they fail to
                answer the question correctly the opposing player gets a chance to answer the question.
                If the opponent answers correctly they get the point. When all the boxes
                have been completed the winner is the player with the most initialized
                boxes.</h3>
